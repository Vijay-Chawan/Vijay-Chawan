 Hello there, I am @Vijay-Chawan.
 
 Interested in Black Hole astrophysics and Exoplanet research.
 Currently, a postgraduate student at the dept. of Physics and Astronomy at National Institute of Technology, Rourkela - India.
 Can contact me @vijaysingh7197@gmail.com
 
My Masters thesis work is on Regular Black Hole Astrophysics. I am working to put constrains on spin parameter and magnetic monopole charge parameter of Rotating Bardeen Black Hole.

My latest published work on Bardeen Regular Black Hole is titled as "Quasar continuum spectrum disfavors black holes with a magnetic monopole charge". It can be find by following this link : https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05385 .
